# topology-research

# required python packages:
numpy, matplotlib, networkx, joblib, galois

# class in folder "topolgies/":
Slimfly, RRG and Equality are implemented as child classes of "Unidirected_graph"
While GDBG is implemented separately because of its di-graph nature.

# TODOs: 
0. Implement Dragonfly
1. Test the same static routing functions (k-shortest path, ALLPATH(H), uniform_load) in four topologies.
3. what can be derived from the EP-link load function.
4. What if the traffic is random uniform instead of uniform?
5. Slimfly link load calculation on p????
