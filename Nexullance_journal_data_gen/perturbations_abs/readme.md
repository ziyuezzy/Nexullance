This set of experiment aims to test the effectectiveness of the nexullance method, when there are small pertubations on the traffic demand matrix presents.
The pertubations are generated by imposing a small amount of noise to each entry of the traffic demand matrix. The RNG is seeded so that the same pertubations are applied to the matrices in different runs.


Baseline (ECMP_ASP): perturbated and unperturbated demand matrices with ECMP_ASP

Optimal network throughput: perturbated and unperturbated demand matrices with Nexullance_APST_4 on each demand matrix.

Comparison group 1: perturbated and unperturbated demand matrices with Nexullance_APST_4 on the unperturbated demand matrix.

Comparison group 2: perturbated and unperturbated demand matrices with Nexullance_IT on the unperturbated demand matrix.

Repeat this for different traffic patterns.
